/**
 * @file Firestore Security Rules
 * @description This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for data access.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - User profiles are stored under `/users/{userId}`.
 * - Projects are stored under `/projects/{projectId}` and contain an `ownerId` field.
 * - Tasks are stored under `/tasks/{taskId}` and contain an `ownerId` field.
 * - Invoices are stored under `/invoices/{invoiceId}` and contain an `ownerId` field.
 * - Expenses are stored under `/expenses/{expenseId}` and contain an `ownerId` field.
 * - Contacts are stored under `/contacts/{contactId}` and contain an `ownerId` field.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only read and write their own user profile.
 * - Projects, Tasks, Invoices, Expenses and Contacts can be read by anyone, but only the owner can create, update, or delete them.
 * - Schema validation is relaxed in this prototype phase except for fields that are critical for authorization.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - The rules rely on an `ownerId` field within the Project, Task, Invoice, Expense, and Contact documents to quickly determine ownership.
