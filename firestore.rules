/**
 * @file Firestore Security Rules
 * @version 2
 *
 * @Core Philosophy
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model, where users can only
 * read and write data they own. All data is stored in top-level collections
 * like /projects/{projectId} and /tasks/{taskId}. Ownership is determined by
 * the `ownerId` field in each document.
 *
 * @Data Structure
 * The Firestore database contains several top-level collections:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user profile data.
 * - /projects/{projectId}: Stores project data, with an `ownerId` field.
 * - /tasks/{taskId}: Stores task data, with an `ownerId` field.
 * - /invoices/{invoiceId}: Stores invoice data, with an `ownerId` field.
 * - /expenses/{expenseId}: Stores expense data, with an `ownerId` field.
 * - /contacts/{contactId}: Stores contact data, with an `ownerId` field.
 *
 * @Key Security Decisions
 * - User listing is disallowed.
 * - The default security posture is owner-only access.
 * - Data validation is limited to relational integrity checks (e.g., ownerId matches auth.uid).
 *
 * @Denormalization for Authorization
 * The `ownerId` field is crucial for authorization. To avoid costly `get()`
 * calls, this field is denormalized directly onto each document. This allows
 * for simple, performant rules like `isOwner(resource.data.ownerId)`.
 *
 * @Structural Segregation
 * All collections use a single collection with ownerId checks. No data is inherently public.
