/**
 * @file Firestore Security Rules
 * @core_philosophy This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for data access.
 *   Each user can only access their own profile and the resources they own (projects, tasks, documents, expenses, contacts).
 *   Data validation is relaxed in this prototyping phase, focusing on authorization.
 * @data_structure
 *   - /users/{userId}: Stores individual user profiles. Access is restricted to the owning user.
 *   - /projects/{projectId}: Stores project data.  Each project has an `ownerId` field indicating ownership.
 *   - /tasks/{taskId}: Stores task data. Each task has an `ownerId` and `assigneeId` field.
 *   - /invoices/{invoiceId}: Stores financial documents. Each document has an `ownerId` field.
 *   - /expenses/{expenseId}: Stores expense data. Each expense has an `ownerId` field.
 *   - /contacts/{contactId}: Stores contact data. Each contact has an `ownerId` field.
 * @key_security_decisions
 *   - User listing is disallowed.
 *   - All write operations are protected by an ownership check.
 *   - Data validation is minimal, focusing on the presence and correctness of the `ownerId` field.
 * @denormalization_for_authorization To avoid `get()` calls in rules, each document includes an `ownerId` field.
