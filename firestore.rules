/**
 * @file Firestore Security Rules
 * @description This ruleset enforces a user-ownership model where users can only read and write data they own, with public read access for certain top-level collections.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores individual user profiles. Only the authenticated user can access their own profile.
 * - /projects/{projectId}: Stores project data. Only the project owner can create, update, or delete projects. Public read access is allowed.
 * - /tasks/{taskId}: Stores task data. Only the task owner can create, update, or delete tasks. Public read access is allowed.
 * - /invoices/{invoiceId}: Stores financial document data. Only the document owner can create, update, or delete documents. Public read access is allowed.
 * - /expenses/{expenseId}: Stores expense data. Only the expense owner can create, update, or delete expenses. Public read access is allowed.
 * - /contacts/{contactId}: Stores contact data. Only the contact owner can create, update, or delete contacts. Public read access is allowed.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User listing is explicitly disallowed.
 * - All write operations are protected by an ownership check.
 * - Public read access is granted to projects, tasks, invoices, expenses and contacts collections, but write access is restricted to the owner.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - The `ownerId` field is used within projects, tasks, invoices, expenses and contacts documents to enforce ownership. This allows for efficient security checks without additional reads.
