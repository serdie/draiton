/**
 * @file Firestore Security Rules
 * @description This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model, ensuring that users can only access their own data.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user profile information. Only the user can read/write their own profile.
 * - /projects/{projectId}: Stores project details.  Requires 'ownerId' field on the document.
 * - /tasks/{taskId}: Stores individual tasks. Requires 'ownerId' field on the document.
 * - /invoices/{invoiceId}: Stores invoices, quotes, and other financial documents. Requires 'ownerId' field on the document.
 * - /expenses/{expenseId}: Stores business expenses. Requires 'ownerId' field on the document.
 * - /contacts/{contactId}: Stores CRM contacts. Requires 'ownerId' field on the document.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only read and write their own user profile data.
 * - Listing of users is forbidden.
 * - Projects, tasks, invoices, expenses and contacts require an 'ownerId' field to enforce ownership.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - Each document in the 'projects', 'tasks', 'invoices', 'expenses', and 'contacts' collections must contain an `ownerId` field
 *   that matches the user's UID. This denormalization enables efficient owner-based security rules without additional reads.
