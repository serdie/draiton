/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for the application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for most data,
 * ensuring that users can only access data they own. It prioritizes
 * security and data privacy. Public read access is only granted when the data model
 * explicitly supports it with an ownership field.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user profiles, accessible only to the authenticated user.
 * - /projects/{projectId}: Stores project data, accessible only to the project owner.
 * - /tasks/{taskId}: Stores task data, accessible only to the task owner.
 * - /invoices/{invoiceId}: Stores invoice data, accessible only to the invoice owner.
 * - /expenses/{expenseId}: Stores expense data, accessible only to the expense owner.
 * - /contacts/{contactId}: Stores contact data, accessible only to the contact owner.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User listing is disallowed to protect user privacy.
 * - Default security posture for ambiguous relationships is strict owner-only access.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * The 'ownerId' field is crucial for efficient authorization. All documents
 * (projects, tasks, invoices, expenses, contacts) MUST have this field to link
 * them to their respective owners. This enables fast and simple ownership checks
 * without additional database reads.
