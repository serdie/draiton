/**
 * @file Firebase Security Rules for Firestore.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model.  Most collections are secured such that only the owner (the authenticated user whose UID matches the `ownerId` field in the document) can create, read, update, or delete documents.  User profiles are self-creatable, meaning a user can create their own profile document upon sign-up.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user profile data.  `userId` must match the authenticated user's UID.
 * - /projects/{projectId}: Stores project data. Each document must have an `ownerId` field matching the user who created it.
 * - /tasks/{taskId}: Stores task data. Each document must have an `ownerId` and `assigneeId` field.
 * - /invoices/{invoiceId}: Stores invoice data. Each document must have an `ownerId` field.
 * - /expenses/{expenseId}: Stores expense data. Each document must have an `ownerId` field.
 * - /contacts/{contactId}: Stores contact data. Each document must have an `ownerId` field.
 * - /employees/{employeeId}: Stores employee data. Each document must have `ownerId` and `companyOwnerId` fields.
 * - /fichajes/{fichajeId}: Stores clock-in/clock-out records. Each document must have an `ownerId` field.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User listing is disabled.
 * - Default security posture for ambiguous relationships is strict owner-only access.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * This ruleset assumes that all documents that need authorization checks have an `ownerId` field that stores the UID of the owning user. This is essential for efficient security rules that don't require expensive `get()` operations.
